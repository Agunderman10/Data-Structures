/*
 * What is a queue?
 *     A queue is a linear data structure which models real world queues by having two primary operations,
 *     namely enqueue and dequeue. Every queue has a front and a back. A visual representation is shown below.
 *     
 *     elem elem elem elem elem
 *     ^queue front        ^queue back
 *     
 *     In a queue we insert elements through the back and remove through the front. Adding elements to the back of the
 *     queue if called enqueueing and removing an element from the front is called dequeuing. Sometimes enqueue may
 *     also be called adding or offering and dequeuing may be called polling or removing.
 *

 * What is Union Find?
 * 
 *     Union Find is a data structure that keeps track of elements which are split into one or more disjoint sets. It
 *     has two primary operations: find and union. 
 *     
 *     Find - given an element the UnionFind will tell you what group that element belongs to. 
 *     Union - merges two groups together
